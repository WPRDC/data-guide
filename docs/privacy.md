#Protecting Privacy

##Introduction
Open data publishing requires policies, procedures, and actions to protect individuals and organizations from unintentional sharing of personally identifiable information (PII). In some cases, sharing data including PII can cause people serious harm. The proliferation of digital public records, data contained in social media, inadequate policies for managing and protecting PII, and inconsistent data management practices increase the likelihood that PII can be combined across multiple sources to uniquely identify an individual. This section of the guide is designed to help publishers identify PII, and take steps to minimize the risk and harm of a breach. 

The Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center is NOT equipped to offer legal advice or opinions related to data sharing. We encourage organizations with questions to contact appropriate legal counsel with any questions related to the legal aspects of data sharing. 

##What is Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Personally identifiable information (PII) is “information about a person that contains some unique identifier, including but not limited to name or Social Security Number, from which the identity of the person can be determined.” [GSA 2014] This description includes both information that directly identifies an individual, such as a name, and information, such as race or gender, that can identify individuals when combined with other information.

The list below describes what might be considered personally identifiable information (PII). It is not meant to be exhaustive but is intended to provide examples and context as to what might be considered PII.

Privacy law and respective legal standards ultimately determine what constitutes PII.  Therefore, the definition of PII varies by jurisdiction and also on a case-by-case basis. 

##What are Public Agencies Required to Share?
Public records in Pennsylvania are subject to the presumption of openness standard in the Commonwealth’s Right-to-Know Law. This standard dictates that all records are presumed to be open to the public unless:
1. Disclosure is prohibited by law, regulation, or judicial order; 
2. Disclosure is prohibited by privilege, such as attorney-client or doctor-patient privileges; 
3. The requested information meets one of 30 criteria outlined in Section 708 in Pennsylvania’s Right-to-Know Law 
4. 
5. AND agencies deem the risks of public disclosure outweigh the benefits. (check on this)

The presumption of openness standard places the burden of proof on agencies to demonstrate any exemption criteria are met. 
Most of the exemption criteria in Section 708 are related to the release of PII, drafts of internal documentation, or records that would pose public risks if released.  It should be emphasized that public agencies can release information that meet the Section 708 exemption criteria if they deem such release in the public’s best interest.  

Additional information about Pennsylvania’s Right-to-Know Law, including a list of Section 708 exemptions, can be found at http://panewsmedia.org/legal/openrecords.

In addition to Right-to-Know laws, individuals may have certain rights to access or be aware of information that pertains to them.  


##Privacy Review Process
Harm
 and a comparison of how other publishers have handled this dataset.
Some organizations that share open data also incorporate a legal review process as part of the privacy review. 

he evaluation can also provide guidance in what data de-identification and anonymization practices would need to be applied prior to release. 





The assessment should also determine if any individuals are significantly harmed by publishing the data.

Additional aspects of the privacy review can 




####Assessing the Harm Caused by a Data Breach



####Reducing the Likelihood of a Data Breach

The probability of a breach related to open data can be minimized by a thorough a thorough review of information being shared as open data, and the implementation of management practices designed to reduce the opportunity for unintentional disclosure. 



####Comparison to Other Communities
Sharing data is not a new phenomenon. Valuable information can be gained by looking at how other organizations share a particular dataset, or what types of policies and practices they've developed.

####Data Quality Assessment

After an organization decides to share information as open data, and has determined that release will cause minimal harm to any individual, a data quality assessment should be undertaken. Every dataset that is shared as open data should be rigorously evaluated before publication to ensure that sensitive information is not being inadvertently shared. Test de-identification or anonymization . TSeveral elements to look for include: 

- Unstructured or semi-structured fields
that may contain 

- Fields with inconsistent content
Can be caused by improper sorting or other errors in managing data - look for inconsistency in a data field

- Check de-identified data

- Check to be sure no unique records in anonymized data.











Some data that contains PII is often released as open data...

###4. Evaluate the Consequences of a PII Breach


 Examining data to identify for quality issues, and validation, and also the degree to which individuals can be uniquely identified in the data if linked to other sources of information. For example, data that contains unstructured information (such as notes fields) can sometimes contain PII. In some cases, data that has been stripped of names can still be linked to other information to identify unique individuals.

The severity of a breach includes potential liability to both individuals and organizations.  The severity are a breach of PII are influenced by the sensitivity of the information. the context in which it is used, and obligations organizations may have to protect the information. Since the selection and definition of severity categories are subjective, staff might openly discuss examples of consequences that meet the various severity criteria.

##How to Reduce the Risk of Accidentally Releasing PII or other sensitive information
There are several actions your organization can take to minimize the risk of accidentally releasing data containing PII or other sensitive information. The information in the publishers guide summarizes more-detailed information presented in UCSUR's 2015 White Paper "Frameworks to Protect Personally Identifiable Information and Assess the Risk of Unintended Breaches"



#### Inventory PII
Developing a catalog of the PII is held by the organization can inform internal processes and procedures designed to protect privacy. This inventory can include information about: 
- what type of PII exists
- file structures and formats
-  data is created, managed and used, 
- access and retention policies, and
- applicable laws and policies governing the data.

####  Eliminate Unnecessary Collection and Retention of PII
Organizations shouldn't collect PII unless the information is essential. Where feasible, governments can also reduce the risk of a PII breach by eliminating unnecessary copies of data containing PII. 

#### Develop Information Security Policies and Procedures  
Local governments can reduce the risk of a breach of PII by developing and applying policies and procedures for data security, access, and management throughout the life cycle of data. Additional protections that can be adopted by local governments include developing information retention schedules, storage, and disposal procedures. It's a good practice to document these processes, reference them in matadata, and share them with others in the organization. 



#### Develop policies and procedures for managing a breach 
Organizations can limit consequences by developing a breach management plan that outlines policies and procedures for managing a breach, and staff that should be involved in the response. Responses to breaches should be proactive, timely, and efficient. The breach management plan can include a timeline of breach responses policies and procedures. If a breach is suspected, the response team should clearly investigate details associated with the breach, including an estimate of the number of individuals potentially affected, the likelihood the information will be used to cause harm, and the severity of the consequences. The breach management plan should also include communication protocols for internal audiences, the media, and individuals that may have been directly affected.  

#### Create Education and Training Programs
Education and training can help individual staff and the organization take appropriate measures to reduce the risk of a confidentiality breach. Educational materials could include a definition of PII, and a description of applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies. Training can cover data management plans and practices, and can also address actions to take in response to a breach.

#### Be Transparent
Sharing information on open data plans and policies can result in valuable feedback to the data publisher. This information can be used to develop publication priorities, educate data users, and enhance efforts to protect privacy. Also share information on what was done to protect sensitive information in the metadata...

#### Establish Periodic Reviews of PII Policies and Procedures
Legal and legislative standards, security controls, information technology, and the information itself will all change over time.  Maintaining effective practices to protect PII will require a commitment to routinely revisiting internal policies and procedures.
