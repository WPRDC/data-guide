#Protecting Privacy

##Introduction
Open data publishing requires policies and actions to protect individuals and organizations from unintentional breaches of personally identifiable information (PII). The proliferation of digital public records, data contained in social media, inadequate policies for managing and protecting PII, and inconsistent data management practices increase the likelihood that PII can be combined across multiple sources to uniquely identify an individual. This section of the guide is designed to help publishers identify PII, and take steps to minimize the risk and harm of a breach.

##What is Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Personally identifiable information (PII) is “information about a person that contains some unique identifier, including but not limited to name or Social Security Number, from which the identity of the person can be determined.” [GSA 2014] This description includes both information that directly identifies an individual, such as a name, and information, such as race or gender, that can identify individuals when combined with other information.

Privacy law and respective legal standards ultimately determine what constitutes PII.  Therefore, the definition of PII varies by jurisdiction and also on a case-by-case basis. 

##What are public agencies required to share?
Public records in Pennsylvania are subject to the presumption of openness standard in the Commonwealth’s Right-to-Know Law. This standard dictates that all records are presumed to be open to the public unless:
1. Disclosure is prohibited by law, regulation, or judicial order; 
2. Disclosure is prohibited by privilege, such as attorney-client or doctor-patient privileges; 
3. The requested information meets one of 30 criteria outlined in Section 708 in Pennsylvania’s Right-to-Know Law AND agencies deem the risks of public disclosure outweigh the benefits.

The presumption of openness standard places the burden of proof on agencies to demonstrate any exemption criteria are met. 
Most of the exemption criteria in Section 708 are related to the release of PII, drafts of internal documentation, or records that would pose public risks if released.  It should be emphasized that public agencies can release information that meet the Section 708 exemption criteria if they deem such release in the public’s best interest.  

Additional information about Pennsylvania’s Right-to-Know Law, including a list of Section 708 exemptions, can be found at http://panewsmedia.org/legal/openrecords.

In addition to Right-to-Know laws, individuals may have certain rights to access or be aware of information that pertains to them.  

##How to reduce the risk of accidentally releasing PII
There are several actions your organization can take to minimize the risk of accidentally releasing data containing PII or other sensitive information. The information in the publishers guide summarizes more-detailed information presented in UCSUR's 2015 White Paper "Frameworks to Protect Personally Identifiable Information and Assess the Risk of Unintended Breaches"

###1. Inventory PII
Developing a catalog of the PII is held by the organization can inform internal processes and procedures designed to protect privacy. This inventory can include information about: 
-what type of PII exists
-file structures and formats
-how data is created, managed and used, 
-access and retention policies, and
-applicable laws and policies governing the data.

###2.  Eliminate Unnecessary Collection and Retention of PII
Organizations should carefully review their PII inventory to eliminate the collection and retention of inessential information.PII not collected, retained, or used cannot pose a risk of breach. Where feasible, governments can reduce the risk of a PII breach by eliminating unnecessary replicas, ensuring that requests for information are clear and necessary. 

###3. Develop Information Security Policies and Procedures  
Local governments can reduce the risk of a breach of PII by developing and applying policies and procedures for data security and management throughout the life cycle of data. Additional protections that can be adopted by local governments include developing information retention schedules and disposal procedures and including such procedures in the metadata. Organizations should also have a process in place in the advent of an inadvertent breach of PII.

###4. Evaluate the Consequences of a PII Breach
