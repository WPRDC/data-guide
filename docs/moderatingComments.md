#Moderating Comments

Comments can be a great way for publishers to communicate with data users. Comments provide users with a way to ask questions or share observations about data.  Comments from users can lead to improved data quality and also provide publishers with a sense of how others are using their information. The Regional Data Center uses Disqus <Link> as it's commenting platform. Disqus provides a series of tools that allow the Data Center and its partners to manage effective conversations on the data portal. Organizational administrators are responsible for moderating and responding to comments about data their organization publishes in a timely fashion. Disqus provides moderators with the ability to edit comments. Disqus also provides Data Center managers with tools to set rules on how comments appear, and filters to delete comments with objectionable language or those that are "spam".
