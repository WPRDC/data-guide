#Publishing on CKAN

This section of the publisher's guide covers the process for manually publishing a dataset to the Regional Data Center's open data portal.

The open data portal used by the Regional Data Center is powered by open source software called CKAN... 


### Before creating a dataset the first time, you'll need to make sure that:

1. You are logged-in to CKAN and your account has the appropriate permissions enabling you to publish
2. Your data file is machine readable and is in an appropriate file format. Refer to the "preparing your data" section of this guide. 
3. You have created a data dictionary for your file. See the "creating a data dictionary" section of this guide.
4. You are prepared to create a metadata record for your dataset. Metadata is created as part of this publishing process. For more on metadata, please see the "creating metadata" section of the publisher's guide.

### Before updating an existing resource within the dataset, you'll need to make sure that:

1. You are logged-in to CKAN and your account has the appropriate permissions enabling you to publish data.
2. Your data file is machine readable and is in an appropriate file format. Refer to the "preparing your data" section of this guide.

### Accounts and Roles

Roles
Each role has a list of permitted actions appropriate for a protected object.

Currently there are four basic roles:

reader: can read the object
anon_editor: anonymous users (i.e. not logged in) can edit and read the object
editor: can edit, read and create new objects
admin: admin can do anything including: edit, read, delete, update-permissions (change authorizations for that object)
