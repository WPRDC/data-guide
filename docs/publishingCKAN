#Publishing on CKAN

This section of the publisher's guide covers the process for manually publishing a dataset to the Regional Data Center's open data portal.

The open data portal used by the Regional Data Center is powered by open source software called CKAN... 


### Before creating a dataset the first time, you'll need to make sure that:

1. You are logged-in to CKAN and your account has the appropriate permissions enabling you to publish
2. Your data file is machine readable and is in an appropriate file format. Refer to the "preparing your data" section of this guide. 
3. You have created a data dictionary for your file. See the "creating a data dictionary" section of this guide.
4. You are prepared to create a metadata record for your dataset. Metadata is created as part of this publishing process. For more on metadata, please see the "creating metadata" section of the publisher's guide.

### Before updating an existing resource within the dataset, you'll need to make sure that:

1. You are logged-in to CKAN and your account has the appropriate permissions enabling you to publish data.
2. Your data file is machine readable and is in an appropriate file format. Refer to the "preparing your data" section of this guide.

### Creating a CKAN Account

Creating an account on CKAN involves visiting the Regional Data Center website <https://data.wprdc.org/user/register> and entering a user name, password, and email address.

### Logging-in to CKAN

To be able to publish a dataset, you must be logged in to the open data portal using your CKAN account. To login, please visit <https://data.wprdc.org/user/login>


### Accounts and Roles

All accounts initially created on CKAN lack publishing permissions. To publish data, your account will need to have either an editor or admin role. 

Only the Regional Data Center or the designated CKAN administrator at your organization is able to assign the appropriate role to your account. 

You will need to provide them with your CKAN user name to assign you as an administrator ror editor.

Accounts in CKAN can have one of 3 roles. The roles available within CKAN include:

member: members can view private datasets owned by their organization, but cannot add data to the site.
editor: can edit, read and create new objects on CKAN
admin: admin can do anything including: edit, read, delete, and update permissions (change authorizations for that object)

### Datasets and Resources Defined

It's best to think of datasets within CKAN as a container that holds information. The information or resources in the ccontainer...

### Creating a Dataset

Manually uploading data to CKAN involves a two step process. The first step in the process involves the creation of a dataset. 

### Creating a Resource Within a Dataset



- creating views
### add data to groups

All data published through the open data portal should be assigned to one or more groups. Groups are topical categories that make it easier for users to find information by topical area. On the open data portal, there are 16 groups designated. The primary group assignment for a dataset should be made through the metadata record, however datasets can be assigned to multiple groups if appropriate.

Assigning datasets to additional groups can be done through the groups tab on the dataset "landing page"

### Data Center Privacy Review: Publish New Datasets as Private

The Regional Data Center takes privacy seriously. We require all publishers to understand the privacy implications of data shared through the Regional Data Center. 

More information on handling sensitive data is available in the privacy section of this publisher's guide. 
As one final check, we also require all datasets being published for the first time be marked as "private." Datasets can be published privately by...
The Regional Data Center will check to see if any datasets are ready for review prior to their going "live" at least once per weekday. If any potential issues are found with the data, you will be contacted by the Regional Data Center. If none are founnd, then Regional Data Center staff will publish your dataset as open data!
We encourage publishers to proactively contact us by phone or email if there are any questions about privacy when publishing a dataset.

When updating resources within a dataset, there is no need to designate the dataset as private unless substantial changes affecting the design or composition of resources within the dataset have been made.
