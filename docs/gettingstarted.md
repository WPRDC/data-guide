Here's what new organizations need to know before sharing data on the Regional Data Center Website.

##Eligibility
- Government, Academic, and Nonprofit organizations are eligible to share data on the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center's open data portal.
- The service is provided at no cost to eligible organizations. 
- Once an organization becomes a publisher with the Data Center, the organization will have their own "organization" page created on the Data Center Website. <LINK>

##Checklist
-Before a new publisher can share information through the Regional Data Center, the following steps must be completed.
- 1. Return an executed Data Deposit Agreement
- 2. Complete New Publisher Training Class
- 3. Share a copy of the organization's logo and description for use on the Website 
- 4. (Optional) Develop a department listing for use with metadata documentation.

##Data Deposit Agreement
- In order to share data with the Data Center, a Data Deposit Agreement will need to be completed and returned. A copy of the agreement can be found on the Regional Data Center Website.
- Electronic submissions of the agreement are encouraged. A scanned version of the document can be emailed to the Data Center <mailto: www.wprdc.org>. The completed agreement can be included as an email attachment.
- The person signing the Data Deposit Agreement as a representative of the publishing organization must have the authority to commit the publishing organization into an agreement with the University of Pittsburgh.

##New Publisher Training Class
- The Regional Data Center will add a new class of data publishers each month. 
- Organizations interested in publishing data should contact the Regional Data Center.
- Organizations will need to complete the training program before publishing, and work with Regional Data Center project staff to create accounts and configure the Website.
- In training classes, new organizations will learn how to:
-- determine publishing priorities
-- protect sensitive information
-- prepare data for publication
-- load data to the Regional Data Center Website
-- create metadata documentation
- Training classes will be held in Oakland, and will likely expand to other locations around the region as demand from publishers grows.
- The training schedule will be posted on the Regional Data Center Website, however interested organizations should first contact the Regional Data Center staff before attending. 

##Organization Logo and Description
- The Regional Data Center will include a logo from all publishing organizations on each publisher's "organization" page on the Website.
- Publishers should share a 189x189 pixel logo with the Regional Data Center for use on the Website. Most common graphic file formats (e.g. gif, jpg, etc) are acceptable.
- A brief description of each organization should also be provided for inclusion on the Website. Two to three sentences should be plenty. For examples, please see the Regional Data Center Website.
