# Creating a data dictionary

Once you've created your dataset and loaded the data onto the portal, one important step before publication is adding a data dictionary.

## What is a data dictionary?

Much like a regular dictionary defines words and tells the reader how to use them, a data dictionary explains all the columns (fields) of your data with enough detail that the reader can start using your data.

It lists each field name that appears in the table of data, provides a definition for the field, specifies the type of data in that field (e.g., 'string' or 'integer'), and gives an example value that could occur in that field.

## Why are data dictionaries important?

Published data often has field names that are deliberately short, and they may wind up being cryptic or unclear, particularly to someone unfamiliar with the topic that the data describes. Data dictionaries are a simple way to make the data you publish more accessible to other people. You can also include in the definition things that might not be clear from just looking at the raw data.

## Suggested formats




The Notes field is a good place to put information that does not fit anywhere else. For instance, if it was necessary to transform ID data from one form to another to get a standardized ID, this could be described in the Notes section documenting that field.

define the raw data itself but instead relates to how the data has been

Other suggestions: We like to name fields by making all the letters lowercase and converting spaces and other punctuation to the underscore character \(\_\). So, we would convert the field name 

## How to create a data dictionary
Hint: You can use a spreadsheet program.

- Include data_dictionary_example.csv
- Include data_dictionary_template.csv

Check it over by opening it in a text editor, to make sure that Excel didn't format anything (like dates) weirdly.
