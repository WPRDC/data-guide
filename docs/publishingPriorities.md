#Establishing Publishing Priorities

Some organizations have had a tough time deciding what type of data to share. This page is designed to provide advice in determining what data to publish, and is based on the experiences of other organizations as they made decisions on what types of data to publish. Don't worry if the quality of your organization's data is not that great. Users often provide feedback that will result in improvements to the quality of your data.

###Examine data requests
A great place to start is to look at a list of the data requests your organizations have recently received. These may consist of both formal "Right to Know Law" requests, and informal requests from external partners and residents. Proactively sharing data can lead to enhanced productivity.
