## "Datasets" & "Resources"
For CKAN purposes, data is published in units called "datasets". A dataset is a package or container for data and other information - for example, it could be the crime statistics for a city, the spending figures for a government department, transcripts from city council meetings, or temperature readings from multiple weather stations. When users search for data, the search results they see will be individual datasets.

A dataset contains two things:

*Information or "metadata" about the data. For example, the title and publisher, date, what formats it is available in, what license it is released under, etc. For information and guidance related to the Data Centerâ€™s metadata standard, please see http://www.wprdc.org/documenting-data/.

*A number of "resources" that hold the data itself.  A dataset can contain any number of resources. For example, different resources might contain the data for the same dataset from different years, a data dictionary describing the fields in a data table, or they might contain the same data in a number of different formats.

CKAN accepts data in many different formats. A resource can be in a variety of formats, including (but not limited to): CSV, Excel spreadsheet, text file, JSON, PDF document, JPEG image file, etc. CKAN can store the resource internally or provide a link to resources hosted elsewhere on the web.
